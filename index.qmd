# Can an AI Obtain our Master’s Degree?
![](img/AI.png)

## Or...

- Could a student use generative AI to complete their coursework and succesfully obtain a degree?
- Would it be possible that students that graduate our programme do not meet the exit requirements?
- Can student performance be leveraged by the use of generative AI?
- Where can we identify opportunities and pitfalls in the validity of our assessments, given that students use generative AI?


## Project Overview
- **Focus**: Investigating the potential of AI as 'student candidates' in the MSBBSS Research Master’s program.
- **Finish**: August 31, 2024.
- **AI Tools**: Utilizing [ChatGPT]() and [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) as these are the most advanced AI models available that are relevant in our field.

## Methodology
- **Coursework Participation**: AI models will participate in various coursework and assessments. 
- **Evaluation Criteria**: Performance evaluation across different assignment types.
- **Impact Analysis**: Assessing the effect of AI on student evaluations and academic testing validity.

### Planned course of action

Our team consists of 3 members: Anne Scheel, Laurence Frank and Gerko Vink. We are assisted by a student assistant. We plan to work as follows for every course:

- 3 out of 4 make the coursework, exam or test
- The assistant serves as the *novice* user
- We aggregate our findings and record our observations
- We present our findings to the teachers and discuss the results
- We write a manuscript detailing our findings and analyses. 

## So far
We are currently awaiting ethical clearance for our research.

- We have geared our projects towards a collaborative effort of the whole research master's programme. 
- All involved coordinators have agreed to grade the AI-assisted coursework and tests.
  - This ensures that our AI assisted course work is evaluated by the same standards as the course work of regular students.


## Deliverables
- **AI Coursework Completion**: Extent to which AI models can complete coursework.
- **Performance Analysis**: AI performance in various assignments and tests. 
- **Educational Impact**: Insights on AI-assisted learning in higher education.

This project is funded by the School of Social and Behavioral Sciences as a Faculty USO project and is executed in close collaboration with USO consortium on generative AI in higher education.

## AI in higher education USO project
- Work package 1: teaching and instructor support
- Work package 2: students and learning support
- Work package 3: grading and assessment
- Work package 4: AI literacy as a future skill

**Aims**
This USO project has a highly explorative nature and seeks to grasp the consequences of generative AI for higher education. We seek to build a shared body of knowledge through educational interventions about the risks and possibilities of generative AI, and their use or avoidance in teaching and learning. This hopefully leads towards a stronger reflective AI awareness among staff and students.

# Open Education

## So far
- Last year we presented the start of this project here: [www.gerkovink.com/koe](https://www.gerkovink.com/koe)

## We now have a book!

## We will

Finalize the book after the draft stage and transfer ownership of [the repository](https://github.com/gerkovink/openeducationbook) to the UU library.

### We invite you
- To read the book
- To contribute to the book: 
- To make your own open educational materials
- To share your open educational materials
- To share your open educational practices

**To further incite an open education movement at Utrecht University and beyond**

To reiterate:

- the book can be read here: [https://www.gerkovink.com/openeducationbook/](https://www.gerkovink.com/openeducationbook/)
- the repository for the book is: [https://github.com/gerkovink/openeducationbook](https://github.com/gerkovink/openeducationbook)
